# String Reverse App

This Java application reads lines from an input text file, reverses each word in the lines, and writes the reversed lines to an output text file.

## Features

- Reads input from `input.txt` located at `c:/Users/vaishnavi.sonawane/Documents/AssigmentFile-I/`.
- Reverses each word in every line read from `input.txt`.
- Writes the reversed lines to `output.txt` located at `c:/Users/vaishnavi.sonawane/Documents/AssigmentFile-I/`.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

## Setup

## Usage

1. Ensure `input.txt` is present at `c:/Users/vaishnavi.sonawane/Documents/AssigmentFile-I/` with the content you want to process.
